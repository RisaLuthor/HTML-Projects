Mini projects to demonstrate proficiency in HTML


HTML can be used to create interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars, enabling visitors to navigate the portfolio easily and interact with the content. Integrating CSS with HTML helps in styling the portfolio, ensuring that the design is visually appealing and consistent across different devices. By using HTML for a portfolio, individuals can effectively showcase their work and skills to potential employers, clients, or collaborators in a professional and visually appealing manner.
